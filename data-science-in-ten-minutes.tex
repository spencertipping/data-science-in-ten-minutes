  \section*{Introduction}
  {\bf Data science is not machine learning.} There is no machine learning in
  this guide, because machine learning is the wrong answer to most problems
  you're likely to run into. I've never deployed a machine learning system,
  although I've debugged several misbehaving ones (and will cover how to do
  that).

  A lot of the code examples assume you're running Linux because Linux is the
  go-to platform for medium/big data processing. It's also ideal for small data
  due to optimizations in core utilities like {\tt sort}.\footnote{GNU {\tt
  sort} will compress temporary files, unlike the {\tt sort} that ships with
  OSX.} If you're running a non-Linux OS and want to try stuff, you have a few
  options:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Install \lnk{https://docker.com}{Docker} and create a container from
          the {\tt ubuntu:18.04} image or similar (I'll assume you have this
          setup)
    \item Run a VM like \lnk{https://www.virtualbox.org/}{VirtualBox} and
          install \lnk{https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop}{Ubuntu Desktop} inside it
    \item Rent a \lnk{https://aws.amazon.com/free/}{free tier} Amazon EC2
          instance (you can use the free-tier {\tt t2.nano} or {\tt t2.micro}
          for data science, and they're ideal for learning because they're
          resource-constrained)
    \item Buy a
          \lnk{https://github.com/spencertipping/www/blob/master/datacenter.md}{cheap
          rack server from eBay} and drop Ubuntu Server on it
  \end{itemize}

  Realistically, you probably won't want to use OSX or Windows for distributed
  programming:~your binaries won't be portable to cluster machines, and you'll
  be fighting with things like case-insensitive filesystems, slower core
  utilities, and general inconsistencies that will increase debugging
  time.\footnote{Some of this is a non-issue for JVM processes, e.g.~Hadoop and
  Spark, but a lot of data science is best done with native tools that are more
  powerful, use less memory, and have much lower iteration time.}

  \subsection*{Examples}
  This guide comes with
  \lnk{https://github.com/spencertipping/data-science-in-ten-minutes/tree/master/example}{example
  code} in the original repository. Where necessary, I've included package
  installation commands required to install dependencies on Ubuntu 18.04. Any
  hard dependencies are pretty boring and easy to install; you won't need
  anything like the RVM or any custom libraries.

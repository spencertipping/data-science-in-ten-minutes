\lnk{https://planet.osm.org/}{OSM Planet} is one of my favorite datasets, if for
no other reason than the fact that it's
\lnk{http://spencertipping.com/ni-osm.gif}{so much fun to visualize}. Like
Wikipedia, it's also stored in an awkward XML/bzip2 format; unlike Wikipedia,
though, this format has some relational elements that complicate processing a
bit unless you have tons of memory. First things first:~let's get it downloaded
(this requires about 70GB of free space):

\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo apt install wget
$ wget https://planet.osm.org/planet/planet-latest.osm.bz2 \end{verbatim}

While that's running, let's get into the format a bit.

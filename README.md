Very much WIP at the moment, but it may be of interest in its current state.

A strange, but I think important, take on data science and getting shit done
when the infrastructure and hardware isn't up to the task. If you are generally
fearless and want to become an unstoppable data-shredding machine, this is the
guide for you. If you want to do things the normal way and/or aren't a fan of
gory details, this is _not_ the guide for you, but I'd encourage you to take a
look anyway just to make sure.

I have a [public RocketChat channel for this
project](https://dev.spencertipping.com/channel/datascience) -- you should
totally join if you want to be part of the discussion/planning/iteration. If you
find suboptimalities, please complain as loudly and impolitely as necessary to
get it fixed. Life's too short for things to suck.

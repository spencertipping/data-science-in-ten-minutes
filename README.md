# Data science in ten minutes
...for extremely large values of ten.

Very much WIP at the moment, but it may be of interest in its current state.

A strange, but I think important, take on data science and getting shit done. If
you are generally fearless and want to become an unstoppable data-shredding
machine, this is the guide for you.

I have a [public RocketChat channel for this
project](https://dev.spencertipping.com/channel/datascience) -- you should
totally join if you want to be part of the discussion/planning/iteration. If you
find suboptimalities, please complain as loudly and impolitely as necessary to
get it fixed. Life's too short for things to suck.

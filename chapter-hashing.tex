\section{Hashing}
OK, let's talk about hash functions. Basically, the idea is to deterministically
map each thing you care about to a number, and do so with two statistical
properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Overall, the hash outputs are uniformly distributed
  \item For any given set of real-world diffs you would make to the inputs, the
        diffs of the outputs are also uniformly distributed\footnote{Also called
        ``avalanching,'' although I found that explanation to be a little less
        obviously related to the reason you would care about it.}
\end{enumerate}

Why do we care? Because uniform distributions are flat across the top, which
means stuff gets evenly distributed if you use them as allocation functions.
More importantly for data science, it also means we can easily reason about what
happens when we use hash values in probabilistic data structures.

\subsection{Bloom filters}
Probably the most popular probabilistic data structure, bloom filters behave
like sets of elements that, when asked whether an element is present, will tell
you either ``no'' or ``maybe.''

\section{Hashing}
A hash function lossily compresses inputs into a uniformly-distributed range
that has statistically convenient properties. In particular, hash functions
optimize for the property that any edit to the input has a uniformly-distributed
distribution of impact on the output; that is, if you took a bunch of different
data points in your space of interest, widely or narrowly distributed, the
distribution of their hashed outputs should be close to uniform.

Why do we care? (TODO)
